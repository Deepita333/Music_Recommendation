# Music_Recommendation
A ml model to understand clustering algorithm in machine learning. This is based on content filtering. It will recommend similar songs on the basis of the song you wanna hear.

## How actually the model works ?
1. Feature Engineering: The code combines the "Song Name" and "Artist Name" columns into a single "data" column. This allows the model to consider both song title and artist style when calculating similarities.
2. Vectorization: The code uses CountVectorizer to convert the text in the "data" column into numerical vectors. Each vector represents a song, where each element corresponds to the frequency of a word in the song title and artist name.
3. Cosine Similarity: It quantifies how similar two songs are based on their word frequencies. Songs with similar patterns and word usage get higher cosine similarity scores.
4.  Recommendation Engine: $ The system creates a similarity matrix (DataFrame) representing cosine similarity scores between all song pairs.
$ When the user provides a song name, the system retrieves its corresponding vector from the matrix.
$ The system then finds the 10 songs with the highest cosine similarity scores to the user's chosen song, excluding the song itself. These are the recommended songs.
